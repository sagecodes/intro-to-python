## Setting up your computer

#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))
* We will be using an online text editor for this workshop called Google colab. You can check it out [here](https://colab.research.google.com). Use a google account to sign in. 

Well... that was easy! 


## What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Python No previous experience expected! 

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours. But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own! 

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice


#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Solve Problems in Python
* Play around and break things


### Challenges:
Get the most out of this workshop! We'll occasionally do a "CHALLENGE" where I give you an exercise to do in several minutes. It can be even more effective to partner up with someone next to you, but you can work on your own if you want. No pressure to solve the challenge. I'll share how I would solve it after the time is up.

#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 

This sounds simple but it can get complicated! 

### A VERY brief history

Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

Python is Known ease of learning, code readability (must use code indents), and a massive ecosystem of libraries that easily expand its usefulness is many fields.

Read more about the history of Python [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).


### Who uses Python?

A lot of places do!

- Large Companies (Google, Facebook)
- Startups
- Agencies
- Majority of companies doing data science 

### What can you do with Python

- Web Development
	- Back-End (frameworks: Django, Flask, more)
- Data Science and AI
	- Data Analysis
	- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning
	- Computer Vision
	- Natural Language Processing
- [Embedded(Hardware)](https://micropython.org/)
- Devops

#### Popular Frameworks and libraries to keep in mind

When learning more about Python you'll probably see some of these pop up as you continue to study

- Web
	- Django
	- Flask
	- pyramid

- Data Science
	- Tensorflow
	- Keras
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Scikit Learn
	- OpenCV

*Note*: if you're thinking of exploring data science with python look into using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your python and data libraries

Also [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) is a awesome place to start as well without having to install anything!
